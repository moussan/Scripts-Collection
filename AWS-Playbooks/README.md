# AWS-DDOS-Playbooks
 Creating playbooks for a professional, standards-based security response to a DDoS attack in an AWS cloud environment involves structuring each playbook with clear objectives, steps, roles, tools, and outcomes.
 Here are sample JSON configurations and templates for the playbooks mentioned. These are designed for AWS services like AWS WAF, AWS Shield, and related tools to automate security response actions. You can adapt them to your specific environment.

## These templates and configurations can be combined and tailored for your environment.

### Creating playbooks for a professional, standards-based security response to a DDoS attack in an AWS cloud environment involves structuring each playbook with clear objectives, steps, roles, tools, and outcomes. Below are 10 essential playbooks tailored to address different aspects of a DDoS attack in an AWS setting:

**1. Detection and Initial Response**

Objective: Quickly detect and confirm the DDoS attack.
Steps:
- Enable AWS Shield and monitor AWS CloudWatch for anomalies.
- Use AWS WAF to detect traffic spikes and malicious patterns.
- Confirm attack type and scale using AWS Trusted Advisor and Shield metrics.
- Activate the AWS Shield Response Team (SRT) if using AWS Shield Advanced.

**Outcome: Attack identified, initial response team activated.**

---

**2. Traffic Analysis and Classification**

Objective: Classify incoming traffic to identify legitimate vs. malicious sources.
Steps:
- Analyze CloudFront logs and VPC flow logs for unusual IP patterns.
- Use AWS Athena to query logs for specific attack vectors.
- Identify common attack vectors such as SYN flood or HTTP floods.

**Outcome: Clear classification of attack sources and patterns.**

---

**3. Rate Limiting and Access Control**

Objective: Mitigate attack impact using rate limiting and IP-based controls.
Steps:
- Apply rate-limiting rules in AWS WAF.
- Block malicious IPs using NACLs or Security Groups.
- Use geoblocking for regions contributing to attack traffic.

**Outcome: Reduction in malicious traffic reaching the application.**

---

**4. Traffic Diversion and Scrubbing**

Objective: Redirect and scrub traffic to protect core infrastructure.
Steps:
- Use Amazon CloudFront for caching and distributing traffic.
- B. Redirect traffic through AWS Global Accelerator for scrubbing.
- Configure Route 53 to reroute traffic dynamically.

**Outcome: Malicious traffic minimized before reaching resources.**

---

**5. Scaling Resources to Absorb Attack**

Objective: Ensure infrastructure can handle the increased load.
Steps:
- Use Auto Scaling to dynamically scale EC2 instances and ELBs.
- Optimize RDS and DynamoDB capacity to handle increased requests.
- Adjust S3 bucket settings for higher read/write demands.

**Outcome: Services remain operational despite attack.**

---

**6. Incident Communication and Stakeholder Engagement**

Objective: Keep stakeholders informed and engaged.
Steps:
- Notify stakeholders via AWS SNS or a dedicated incident management tool.
- Provide regular updates on attack status, impact, and response actions.
- Collaborate with AWS Shield Response Team if needed.

**Outcome: Stakeholders informed and engaged in real-time.**

---

**7. Proactive Mitigation with Predefined Rules**

Objective: Preemptively mitigate known DDoS vectors.
Steps:
- Implement AWS WAF managed rules for common attack patterns.
- Use custom rules to block known malicious IP ranges.
- Leverage AWS Shield Advanced for automated threat intelligence.

**Outcome: Reduction in future attack vectors' effectiveness.**

---

**8. Post-Incident Review and Forensics**

Objective: Investigate the attack and assess response effectiveness.
Steps:
- Gather logs from CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and VPC Flow Logs.
- Analyze the logs using AWS Athena and QuickSight for trends.
- Conduct a root cause analysis and document lessons learned.

**Outcome: Comprehensive post-mortem analysis completed.**

---

**9. Policy and Governance Updates**

Objective: Enhance security policies and governance based on attack insights.
Steps:
- Review IAM policies and ensure least privilege is enforced.
- Update NACLs, Security Groups, and WAF rules based on attack patterns.
- Incorporate new insights into security training and policies.

**Outcome: Improved security posture and updated governance framework.**

---

**10. Automation and Testing**

Objective: Automate responses and test readiness for future attacks.
Steps:
- Implement AWS Lambda for automated threat response actions.
- Set up periodic penetration testing using AWS Inspector.
- Test incident response with tabletop exercises and simulated DDoS attacks.

**Outcome: Automated, well-tested response workflows.**
